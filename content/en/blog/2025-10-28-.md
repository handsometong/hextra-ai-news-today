Need Hong Kong bank accounts but can’t fly over? Follow this one-day playbook to finish **HSBC + BOCHK + ZA + Airstar + Ant Bank** entirely online.

## 1. Prep Checklist (Have These Before You Tap “Start”)

| Item | Details | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mainland ID + Exit-Entry Permit | Both must have ≥ 6 months validity | Identity verification + NFC reading |
| Phone number with international roaming | Only for SMS OTP; buy data via roaming/Alipay packs | Receive verification codes |
| Exit-Entry Record PDF | WeChat mini-program “移民局12367” → “出入境记录查询证明” → save PDF | Proves a recent exit record |
| Mailing address (CN + EN) | Include floor + unit; standard abbreviations (BLDG, FL) allowed | Card + PIN delivery, address verification |
| Apps installed | HSBC HK / BOCHK / ZA / Airstar; Ant Bank via Alipay mini-app | Avoid delays mid-application |

> Missing even one item usually means automatic rejection. Double-check the PDF and English address.

## 2. Recommended Order + Steps

Run the big banks first (HSBC → BOCHK), then batch-submit the three virtual banks so you can reuse the same documents.

### 2.1 HSBC (HSBC One)

1. Open HSBC HK app → “I don’t have an HSBC account.”
2. Identity: “I’m in Hong Kong but don’t have a HKID.”
3. Account type: “HSBC One” (no minimum deposit).
4. Fill in info: purpose = “Savings/Investment,” tax ID = Mainland ID number, enter CN + EN addresses.
5. Upload ID + Exit-Entry Permit; use NFC to read the permit chip.
6. Set login credentials and submit—emails usually arrive within minutes.

**Card delivery**: IDEMIA ships via EMS Shenzhen. Follow the “EMS中国邮政速递物流” WeChat service account to track. Ping support if nothing arrives after two weeks.

### 2.2 BOCHK (“Easy Banking/自在理财”)

1. BOCHK app → “Open Account.”
2. Identity: “Chinese Resident ID,” confirm “I am in Hong Kong.”
3. Method: “I am not at a branch,” Account type: “Easy Banking (自在理财).”
4. Upload ID, Exit-Entry Permit, and the Exit-Entry PDF.
5. Complete liveness check + personal info; choose “Investment/Savings” as the purpose.
6. Submit and wait for approval.

### 2.3 Virtual Banks (ZA / Airstar / Ant)

All three share the same flow: fill info → upload docs → face scan.

- Address must include building + floor + unit in English.
- Tax residency: “Only Mainland China,” tax ID = Mainland ID number.
- Upload the Exit-Entry PDF for each bank.
- Ant Bank runs entirely inside the Alipay mini-app—no extra download needed.

## 3. Universal Principles (a.k.a. How Not to Get Rejected)

1. **Consistency beats speed**: Name Pinyin, address, and tax info must match across all five apps.
2. **Submit during HK business hours** (Mon–Fri, 10:00–18:00) for faster human review.
3. **Activate immediately**: once approved, log in and set fingerprint/Face ID so the account is marked “active.”
4. **Keep the mailing address alive**: PIN letters and compliance notices may arrive later.
5. **Screenshot everything**: submission screens + success prompts are lifesavers if support asks for proof.

With this checklist, an NFC-capable phone, and stable internet, you can finish all five applications in a single day. Good luck! 💳
