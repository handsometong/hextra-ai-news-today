The blog documents the craft behind the daily briefing: workflows, tools, experiments, and personal retrospectives. If the daily brief tells you *what* happened, the blog unpacks *how* we make sense of it and build with it.

### Topics we cover

- **Making-of notes** – capture, cleaning, formatting, and publishing pipelines for independent media makers.
- **Product field notes** – from idea to launch with candid lessons about AI-driven products.
- **Creator journeys** – independent hacking, content entrepreneurship, and sustainable routines.

### How to participate

- Leave a giscus comment under any post.
- Pitch your story via [justlikemaki@qq.com](mailto:justlikemaki@qq.com).
- Join the WeChat community to discuss workflows with other readers.

This is our lab for long-form ideas—expect in-depth case studies, interviews, and toolkits designed to be remixed by the community.
