## Who I am

Hi, I’m **handsometong** — product engineer, writer, and the person behind AI News Today. A decade in software taught me that fast-moving industries need deliberate human filters. This project started as a way to reassemble scattered AI news, research, and builder stories into a briefing that actually helps people act.

> “Technology serves people” is not a slogan; it is a daily practice of writing, coding, and reflecting in one loop.

## Editorial principles

1. **Traceable facts** – sources are cited, context is preserved, and opinions are clearly labeled.
2. **Value over hype** – we would rather publish slower than amplify noise.
3. **Respect for creators** – every quote, translation, or adaptation is cleared or credited.
4. **Readers as partners** – content is written from the perspective of builders who need to use it immediately.


## Behind AI News Today

- **Workflow**: morning collection → noon shortlist → evening fact-check → night publish, supported by automation plus manual review.
- **Stack**: Hugo + Hextra theme, self-written scraping scripts, deployed through Cloudflare and Netlify.
- **Community feedback**: comments, WeChat groups, and the newsletter inbox feed into a weekly retrospective.

## What I am exploring now

- Practical LLM deployments such as agent collaboration and knowledge-aware workflows.
- Communication systems for individuals and small teams—how to explain complex topics clearly and consistently.
- Better reading experiences: dark mode, reading progress, code copy buttons, and more.
