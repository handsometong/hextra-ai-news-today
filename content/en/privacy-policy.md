# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: 1 June 2025*

Thank you for trusting AI News Today. This policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share information when you access the site or interact with us. By continuing to use the service, you agree to the practices described below.

---

## 1. Information we collect

### 1.1 Information you provide
- Name, email, company, interests, and other details submitted through subscription or contact forms.
- Materials you voluntarily share during interviews, feedback sessions, or partnerships.

### 1.2 Information collected automatically
- Device and browser data such as device type, OS version, browser name, preferred language.
- Access logs (IP address, timestamps, referral sources, navigation paths, error logs).
- Session identifiers from cookies or similar technologies.

### 1.3 Third-party sources
- Aggregated analytics data that cannot directly identify an individual.
- Fields shared by identity providers (e.g., social logins) when you explicitly authorize the connection.

We do **not** collect payment credentials, government IDs, or precise geolocation information.

---

## 2. How we use information

- **Deliver content & services** – send newsletters, reply to messages, and provide requested resources.
- **Improve experience** – analyze readership to refine site layout, performance, and relevance.
- **Security & compliance** – detect abusive traffic, enforce usage limits, and respond to legal requests.
- **Communication** – share product updates, event invites, or partnership opportunities. You can opt out anytime.

We never sell or rent personal information. If we plan to use data for a new purpose, we will ask for permission first.

---

## 3. Cookies & similar technologies

We rely on a small number of essential cookies (to keep the site functioning) and optional analytics cookies (to understand what works). You can:

- Disable or delete cookies in your browser settings.
- Use private/incognito mode if you prefer minimal tracking.

Blocking cookies may limit custom preferences, but core reading features will continue to work.

---

## 4. Retention & storage

- Account, subscription, and communication records: deleted within 12 months after you cancel or request removal.
- Analytics logs: stored for 26 months before being aggregated or anonymized.
- Backups: encrypted and hosted in data centers located in the United States and Singapore, subject to local laws.

We periodically review retention schedules and purge data that is no longer needed.

---

## 5. How we protect data

- HTTPS encryption, access control, and audit logging guard our infrastructure.
- Only authorized maintainers can access administrative systems.
- Third-party vendors undergo security reviews and sign data protection agreements.

No online transmission is 100% secure, so please protect your own credentials and notify us if you suspect misuse.

## 6. Your rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may:

1. **Access or export** the data we hold about you.
2. **Correct** inaccurate or incomplete information.
3. **Delete** specific data unless we must retain it by law.
4. **Restrict processing** for direct marketing or other purposes.
5. **Withdraw consent** (for example, unsubscribe or refuse optional cookies).

Send requests via the contact details below. We aim to respond within 30 days.

## 7. Children’s privacy

AI News Today is not directed at children under 13. If we learn that we unintentionally collected data from a minor without parental consent, we will remove it promptly.

---

## 8. Third-party links

We occasionally link to external sites (GitHub, social media, download services). Their privacy practices are independent, so please read the respective policies before interacting.

---

## 9. Policy updates

We may revise this policy as laws or product features change. Significant updates will be announced on the site or via email, and the “last updated” date will be refreshed.
