## Understand the AI landscape in 10 minutes a day

> News x Tools x Research x Actions — a compact brief that you can immediately apply.

AI News Today is a one-person newsroom. Every morning we crawl 50+ sources, double-check facts, and distill what actually matters to builders, operators, and researchers. The goal: reduce the noise, amplify first-hand insight, and offer clear follow-up actions.

### What you will find

- **Daily Brief** – product launches, funding moves, policy signals, and company strategy shifts explained in plain language.
- **Radar / Toolbox** – handpicked models, agents, and workflows worth testing, plus constraints to watch out for.
- **Research Tracker** – conference papers, preprints, and benchmarks with clear takeaways and potential applications.
- **Playbooks** – long-form interviews and project retrospectives that turn hard-won experience into reusable steps.

### Your reading rhythm

1. **Start with the “Today’s Rundown”** to understand the macro storyline in four lines.
2. **Jump into sections** that match your role: product, infra, research, community, or open source.
3. **Take action** by saving ideas, testing new tools, or emailing us to continue the conversation.
