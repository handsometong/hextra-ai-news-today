### Highlights
- Baidu unveils **ERNIE 5.0**, calling it the world’s first “native multimodal” model; Google upgrades **Gemini Live** voice; Fei‑Fei Li’s **World Labs Marble 3D** opens public beta; **SOLO** releases its full version with a limited free window.
- ElevenLabs launches celebrity-approved voice clones, Google invests **USD 6.4B** in a German AI datacentre, and Sam Altman announces **GPT-5.1**—but early testers report hallucination spikes.
- New papers expose profile-poisoning attacks on recommenders, a multi-agent GIS-to-SQL translator, and an LLM “Surgical Copilot.”

### Product & Platform
- **ERNIE 5.0** – Baidu positions it as native multimodal (text/audio/vision trained jointly) and frames “intelligence as the app.”
- **Gemini Live Voice** update – controllable pace, tonal nuance, even themed accents, turning it into an emotional conversation partner for language learning or interview prep.
- **Marble 3D (World Labs)** – generate and edit interactive virtual worlds from text/images/video within ~10 minutes—a statement product for “world models.”
- **SOLO** – full release with major UX upgrades plus a limited-time free tier so anyone can test the toolset.

### Research Notes
- **CREAT** demonstrates reinforcement-learning profile-poisoning on recommenders, achieving strong attacks with minimal fake accounts.
- **Multi-Agent GeoSQL** framework splits entity extraction, logic planning, code generation, and verification so users can query spatial databases via plain language.
- **Surgical AI Copilot** shows how an LLM agent can assist in image-guided surgery—segmenting tumours, tracking instruments, and offering procedural suggestions.

### Industry / Capital
- **ElevenLabs × Hollywood** – authorised celebrity voices enter mainstream synthetic media.
- **Google** commits USD 6.4B to a German AI datacentre, bolstering European capacity.
- **GPT-5.1** claims better instruction following, yet community tests reveal serious hallucinations, reminding teams to validate outputs.

### Community Signals
- Users celebrate Marble’s ability to spin up spatial experiences, but caution that flashy releases still need rigorous reliability benchmarks—especially when hallucinations persist in brand-new models.
