### Highlights
- Meta unveils **Omnilingual ASR** covering 1,600 languages via few-shot context learning; 78% of languages now sit below 10% word-error rate.
- The Australian government pilots **GovAI Chat** for cabinet briefs, while Xiaomi hires renowned researcher Luo Fuli to lead “physical-world intelligence.”
- China’s CAC adds 73 more generative services to the official registry (611 services, 306 API-based apps total), mandating transparent provenance disclosures.

### Product & Platform
- **Omnilingual ASR** proves large-scale recognition needn’t ignore low-resource languages.
- **GovAI Chat** promises faster policy paperwork but raises data-classification questions.
- **Xiaomi AGI Lab** prioritises embodied intelligence and AGI research pipelines.

### Research Notes
- **Gemini 3 Pro** decrypts historical manuscripts (CER 0.56%, WER 1.22%) and shows implicit reasoning when reconstructing missing context.
- **Agent Capability Pyramid** (tool use → adaptability → “groundedness” → common sense) reveals a 40% failure rate on the top tier.
- **Diff-V2M**, **CRM/CRF**, **PPA attacks**, **SGNNs** cover multi-modal generation, simple reward models, sequential recommendation threats, and mechanistic pretraining for science.
- **EHRStruct**, **EHRMaster**, **Fast Multi-Organ Segmentation**, **WaterMod** deliver reproducible medical, imaging, and watermark benchmarks.

### Industry / Capital
- Government pilots (Australia, Beijing AI hospital) show AI becoming baseline infrastructure for public services.
- **Yann LeCun** reportedly plans a world-model startup, even as Meta restructures its AI org.
- TrendRadar, adk-go, Strix, Perkeep, ChinaTextbook, open-source-games, tech-interview-handbook remain top-of-mind in local dev circles.

### Community Signals
- **Mistral Think Mode** feeling terse, **MCP workloads** still blowing Claude token limits, essays about the “AI bubble S-curve,” ListenHub MCP integrations, Marble 3D tests, Defence Department prioritising speed, Amjad Masad’s rapid growth interview, and long-form prompts like “Hacker News insight editor” all reflect a community focused on workflows, not hype.
