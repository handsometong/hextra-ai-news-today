### Highlights
- OpenAI quietly ships **Polaris Alpha** (rumoured GPT‑5.1) with 256K context and knowledge updated to Oct 2024.
- ByteDance unveils **InfinityStar**, a spatiotemporal pyramid framework that renders 5‑second 720p clips in 58 seconds, while Doubao releases **Seed-Code**, a 256K-context agentic coding model with vision.
- Chip veterans form **Majestic Labs** to build AI servers with 1000× memory capacity; Fei‑Fei Li calls spatial intelligence the next frontier and urges investment in world models.

### Product & Platform
1. **Polaris Alpha (OpenAI)** – stealth release featuring 256K context, updated knowledge, and casual coding abilities; community assumes this is GPT‑5.1. Screenshots show natural-language mini-game generation and long-form comprehension.
2. **InfinityStar (ByteDance)** – time/appearance decoupling + knowledge inheritance compress video generation latency to 58 s for 5 s/720p clips. Code is on GitHub for researchers building longer-form video models.
3. **Doubao-Seed-Code** – Doubao’s agentic coding specialist: 256K context, visual understanding of UI mocks/hand sketches, and new monthly pricing for teams shipping agents.

### Research Notes
- **Sekai Dataset** – 5000+ hours of egocentric egoworld footage across 100 countries with scene/weather/trajectory labels, ideal for world models and interactive exploration research.
- **FLEX Paradigm** – lets LLM agents grow via reflective learning (no retraining) by digesting past failures/successes; boosts math and chemistry tasks by up to 23%.
- **Physics-Guided Deblurring** – injecting PDE-inspired modules into vision models yields visibly better motion deblur with only +1% compute.
- **MultiSim** – runs autonomous-driving tests across multiple simulators simultaneously to find bugs that generalise beyond any one environment.

### Industry / Policy
- **Majestic Labs**: founded by three silicon legends to build “thousand-fold” AI servers, signalling a memory-centric architecture race.
- **Brain-computer interfaces** become part of China’s national strategy; Xiaomi hires major talent to accelerate large-model efforts.
- **Fei‑Fei Li** stresses that spatial intelligence + world models will define the next era beyond language.
