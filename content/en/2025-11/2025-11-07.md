### Highlights
- **Comfy Cloud** brings full Stable Diffusion into the browser; Google Maps embeds Gemini; HeyGen 1.0 nails context-aware dubbing; GPT-5 Pro adds real-time context updates; WeChat opens a novel portal.
- Medical imaging benchmarks pit CNNs versus foundation models, text-to-360° surveys reveal the next wave of immersive media, **StutterZero** makes speech therapy AI-first, and **VoxStudio** translates voice to expressive imagery.
- XPENG unveils **IRON** humanoid robots, Google Cloud turns Vertex AI into a self-healing agent platform, Snapchat picks Perplexity as its default AI search, Dubai positions itself as “the new AI Silicon Valley.”

### Product & Platform
- **Comfy Cloud** = cloud GPUs + ComfyUI in your browser. Works even on Macs lacking discrete GPUs.
- **Google Maps + Gemini** offers conversational guidance (“turn right after the red building”) plus Lens-driven local Q&A.
- **HeyGen High-Fidelity Mode** handles occlusions, multi-speaker detection, and lip sync.
- **GPT-5 Pro Context Refresh** means you can revise prompts mid-session without restarting threads.
- **WeChat Novels** invite publishers to monetise AI-generated serials.

### Research Notes
- **CNN vs. FM** results show classical nets still win when data is scarce; foundation models shine when fine-tuned via PEFT on rich datasets.
- **Text→360°** survey wraps up diffusion techniques for VR authoring.
- **StutterZero/StutterFormer** convert disfluent speech to fluent audio + transcripts in one pass.
- **VoxStudio** introduces a speech information bottleneck to capture both linguistic and paralinguistic cues, then paints matching portraits.

### Industry / Capital
- **XPENG IRON** (22 DOF, triple Turing chips) targets malls/car showrooms before opening its SDK.
- **Vertex AI Agent Builder** adds Python/Java SDKs + auto-retry logic.
- **Snapchat × Perplexity** gives the search startup instant distribution to hundreds of millions of Gen Z users.
- **Code Brew Labs** highlights Dubai’s push to integrate ML/NLP into fintech, healthcare, logistics.

### Open Source Radar
- **NocoBase** (low-code), **rachoon** (self-hosted invoices) etc. help SMEs build internal ops quickly.

### Community Signals
- Prompt-cheat collections, AI arbitrage loops, Apple’s accidental App Store source leak, “AI content assembly lines,” Nano Banana 2 UI leaks, and Dotey’s LLM/RAG/Agent analogy show practitioners obsess over both monetisation tricks and conceptual clarity.
