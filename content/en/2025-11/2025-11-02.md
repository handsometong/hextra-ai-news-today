### Highlights
- **NotebookLM + Gemini** brings a 1M-token window, role-configurable goals, and 6× longer conversational memory, while **ChatGPT Agent Mode** arrives for Plus/Pro/Business users to execute actions directly inside the browser—two “research aides” now read documents very differently.
- **CronusVLA**, LVLM rebalancing, and **ReCon-GS** shore up the missing “temporal rhythm” for robots, multimodal models, and video generation.
- The **YFQ-44A** AI jet’s maiden flight, compute supply crunches, and debates around digitally “reviving” friends reveal how entangled AI and the real world are becoming.

### Product / Feature Updates
- **NotebookLM × Gemini** turns into a configurable research partner with million-token context, persona goals, and vastly longer memory. **ChatGPT Agent Mode** lets the browser carry out workflows without manual copy/paste.
- **Google Logo Builder** + Summarizer and other lightweight creative tools show “prompted design” popping up everywhere.

### Research Watch
- **CronusVLA** injects multi-frame memory into vision-language-action models so robots stop going “short-sighted” on dynamic tasks. **LVLM rebalance** strategies deliberately train tail tasks to fight Matthew effects.
- **ReCon-GS** plus mathematical explorations (von Neumann algebras, KMS states, etc.) show visual/audio/parallel computing stacks being reframed for explainable, geometry-aware AI.

### Industry / Capital
- News about the **USAF YFQ-44A** autonomous jet, AI datacentre shortages, and the **Chris-bot** digital afterlife project highlights AI’s reach into security and emotional domains—making governance and ethics urgent.

### Open Source / Tools
- **computer-science** (self-paced CS curriculum), **xiaomusic** (smart speaker integrations), **Copilot CLI**, **BettaFish** (multi-agent sentiment analysis), and **chef** (AI app scaffolding) provide a full ladder for “using AI to build AI tools.”

### Community Signals
- Mathematicians brag GPT-5 drafts proofs in 20 seconds—but still insist on human review. Reddit’s “ChatGPT is just pattern matching” threads remind us to respect model limits.
