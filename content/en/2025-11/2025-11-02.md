### Highlights
- **NotebookLM** upgrades to Gemini with a 1M-token window, role-specific personas, and six times longer conversation memory; **ChatGPT** quietly enables agent mode for Plus/Pro/Business users.
- Robot vision/language/action research (CronusVLA), LVLM rebalancing, and ReCon-GS all tackle multi-frame robustness and temporal alignment.
- The U.S. Air Force’s **YFQ-44A** AI stealth jet flies; CFOs admit AI demand is outpacing compute supply; Reddit discussions wrestle with digital resurrection and AI ethics.

### Product & Platform
- **NotebookLM x Gemini** becomes a configurable research partner with million-token context and goal-driven behaviour settings.
- **ChatGPT Agent Mode** now performs web actions inside the browsing tool—no more copy/paste loops for complex tasks.
- **Google Logo Builder** and similar light-weight creative apps underline how “prompted design” is becoming ambient.

### Research Notes
- **CronusVLA** trains on single frames then finetunes on multi-frame sequences, giving robots “longer sight.”
- **LVLM Rebalancing** methods purposely emphasize tail tasks so large vision-language models stop overfitting easy prompts.
- **ReCon-GS** introduces continuous Gaussian flow + memory-aware optimisations to make dynamic 3D reconstruction practical.
- Explorations of von Neumann algebras, KMS states, and harmonic algebras sketch what next-gen, non-commutative AI compute might look like.

### Industry / Capital
- **YFQ-44A** proves the Pentagon is serious about “software-defined aerospace.”
- Microsoft’s CFO says AI demand feels like an endless well, forcing continuous AI infra investment.
- Reddit’s Chris-bot project—resurrecting a murdered friend’s personality—raises digital identity questions.

### Open Source Radar
- **computer-science** (⭐196k) free CS curriculum, **xiaomusic** (⭐6.5k) smart speaker music bridge, **GitHub Copilot CLI** (⭐4.4k), **BettaFish** (⭐2.9k), **chef** (⭐2.6k) give builders everything from education to automation.

### Community Signals
- Mathematicians praising GPT-5 yet insisting on human verification, Reddit threads declaring “ChatGPT isn’t a person,” and debates over agent hallucinations remind us to keep expectations grounded.
