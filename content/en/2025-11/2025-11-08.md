### Highlights
- Google bakes **File Search RAG** into the Gemini API, launches a local **Summarizer API** in Chrome, and upgrades **Magika 1.0** + **Firecrawl Branding Format** so reading/writing the web is easier than ever.
- **Kimi K2 Thinking** trends overseas; altruistic-agent models and the **Cambrian-S** super-sensing paradigm spark discussions on how AI gains conscience, foresight, and long-chain reasoning.
- Gemini spreads through Workspace while AI programming goes vertical; self-rewriting malware and design-iteration pain become new safety/efficiency flashpoints.

### Product / Feature Updates
- **Gemini File Search** hosts indexes directly so teams can skip DIY RAG.
- **Summarizer API** leverages Gemini Nano for on-device abstracts.
- **Magika 1.0** uses deep models to detect file types for security.
- **Firecrawl Branding Format** pulls entire brand DNA (palette, typography, components) from any URL in one call.

### Research Watch
- **Altruistic agents** explore empathy-driven dopamine rewards; **Cambrian-S** insists large models need “super-sensing” to reason about space. Combined with **Kimi K2 Thinking’s 200+ tool calls**, we’re glimpsing true “thinking models.”

### Industry / Capital
- **AI programming verticalisation** (one prompt = interactive course/game) and **Gemini’s Workspace integration** show giants building unified intelligence layers. Meanwhile, self-mutating malware, design-iteration woes, and text diffusion bottlenecks dominate the risk/efficiency conversation.

### Open Source / Tools
- **Lima (⭐18k)** makes macOS/Linux VMs feel like LEGO; **Frigate (⭐26k)** brings local surveillance intelligence; **code-server (⭐74k)** drops VS Code into any browser; **Strix** and **Vertex AI Creative Studio** focus on “injecting AI superpowers” and sampling Google’s generative APIs.

### Community Signals
- **Tencent Yuanbao right-click summaries**, **Hume AI voice cloning**, the “automate the task you hate first” learning hack, Chrome split view, ad dynamic A/B testing, and overseas **Kimi K2 Thinking** reviews all show people striving to control the info flood while finding prompts/workflows that actually stick.
