### Highlights
- Google bakes **File Search RAG** into the Gemini API, ships a local **Summarizer API** (Gemini Nano), upgrades **Magika 1.0** for file-type safety, and Firecrawl adds a Branding Format extractor.
- Moonshot’s **Kimi K2 Thinking** gets global attention, while new work explores empathic agents and “Cambrian-S” super-sensing paradigms.
- Gemini becomes the “intelligence layer” across Google Workspace; AI coding turns vertical (text diffusion mini-apps). Meanwhile, AI-generated malware now rewrites itself to evade detection, and product teams lament how hard iteration is.

### Product & Platform
- **Gemini File Search** hosts indexes + retrieval pipelines natively, letting teams spin up knowledge bases without bespoke infra.
- **Summarizer API** runs entirely on-device for privacy-sensitive use cases.
- **Magika 1.0** (Rust rewrite) improves detection of malicious scripts.
- **Firecrawl Branding Format** scrapes color palettes, typography, and layout patterns from any URL.

### Research Notes
- **Altruistic Agents** simulate empathy-driven dopamine rewards—possible scaffolding for value-aligned AGI.
- **Cambrian-S** argues that multi-modal models must predict and organise knowledge, not just react to prompts.
- Community tests show **Kimi K2 Thinking** can call tools 200+ times per task, echoing rumours about GPT-5 Codex High.

### Industry / Capital
- AI programming is shifting from generic copilots to domain-specific “text diffusion” frameworks that output full teaching modules or mini-games.
- Gemini becomes Google’s internal OS, while self-mutating malware and design-iteration woes remind everyone that safety + usability remain open problems.

### Open Source Radar
- **Lima**, **Frigate**, **code-server**, **Strix**, and **Vertex AI Creative Studio** demos provide everything from local VMs to generative media samples.

### Community Signals
- Tencent’s **Yuanbao** adds right-click summaries; Hume AI demos one-shot voice conversion; product managers advocate “automate the task you hate first”; Chrome ships built-in split view; niche publishers monetise via “contextual ads”; Kimi K2 Thinking posts gain traction overseas. The theme: workflows > raw models.
