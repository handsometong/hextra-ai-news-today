### Highlights
- Qoder, MiniMax M2.1, Pokee AI, Perplexity Patents, and Adobe Sneaks roll out back-to-back, making the dev + creative pipeline fully AI-native.
- **Qwen3-Max-Thinking**, 3D watermarking, and system-of-systems lifecycle research deliver new paradigms for reasoning models, 3D copyright, and complex engineering.
- Google Search ads evolve, **Odyssey-2** interactive video debuts, and a user slices a USD 195K medical bill down to USD 33K with Claude—AI is hitting real consumer scenarios.

### Product / Feature Updates
- **Qoder JetBrains plugin**, **MiniMax M2.1**, **Pokee AI natural-language workflows**, **Perplexity Patents**, and **Adobe Frame Forward** form a code → campaign chain; “zero configuration” is the new baseline.

### Research Watch
- **Qwen3-Max-Thinking** scoring 100% on AIME/HMMT proves thought chains + tool calls are neck-and-neck with top humans. 3D point-cloud watermarks and SoS lifecycle frameworks protect creators’ rights and guide industrial governance.

### Industry / Capital
- Google’s search VP insists ads won’t disappear—they’ll morph into native formats powered by advanced search + AI queries. **Odyssey-2** offers a glimpse of interactive AI video.

### Open Source / Tools
- **agenticSeek**, **LocalAI**, **MaxKB**, **Everywhere**, **PageIndex** span local agents, open-source model hosting, enterprise knowledge bases, desktop copilots, and reasoning-first RAG indexes—great for pilot projects.

### Community Signals
- OpenAI board testimony leaks, Claude negotiating a USD 195K bill down to USD 33K, users detoxing ChatGPT’s em dash habit, memory slots for coding agents, and Google PAIR’s human-centered AI guide all remind us that transparency, individual skill, and UX discipline matter as much as raw capability.
