## AI News Daily · 4 Nov 2025

### Highlights
- Alibaba’s **Qoder** hits every JetBrains IDE with agent routing, MiniMax teases **M2.1**, Pokee AI lets anyone spin up automation agents via natural language, Perplexity launches **Patents**, and Adobe demos “frame moving” AI video edits.
- **Qwen3-Max-Thinking** posts 100% on AIME & HMMT thanks to tool use + extended thinking; new research secures 3D point clouds and system-of-systems lifecycle management.
- Google reassures advertisers Search ads will “evolve, not vanish,” while **Odyssey-2** proves AI video can be interactive; a user slashes a USD 195K medical bill to USD 33K with Claude.

### Product & Platform
- **Qoder** auto-selects best-fit models per task (Java, Rust, Go) inside JetBrains.
- **MiniMax M2.1** focuses on agent + coding workloads; **Pokee AI** turns “describe task” into runnable multi-app workflows.
- **Perplexity Patents** answers natural-language patent questions and links prior art.
- **Adobe Sneaks** (frame moving) makes complex video edits as easy as content-aware fill for motion.

### Research Notes
- **Qwen3-Max-Thinking** shows how “thinking checkpoints + tool routing” rival top human olympiad scores.
- **Robust 3D Watermarking** embeds binary payloads via SVD + PointNet++, resisting rotation/cropping.
- **SoS Lifecycle** framework emphasises MBSE, reference architectures, and measurable value streams for complex systems.

### Industry / Capital
- **Google Search VP** says ads become more context-aware as AI answers get richer.
- **Odyssey-2** lets users walk around AI-generated worlds in real time.

### Open Source Radar
- **agenticSeek** (local Manus AI), **LocalAI** (open-source drop-in for GPT/Claude), **MaxKB** (enterprise knowledge agents), **Everywhere** (desktop AI hub), **PageIndex** (reasoning-first RAG index) are worth bookmarking.

### Community Signals
- OpenAI board leak, Claude-assisted medical bill negotiation, guides for removing GPT em dashes / adding criticism, “memory files” for coding agents, and Google PAIR’s human-centered AI guidelines show practitioners care about transparency and UX, not just benchmarks.
