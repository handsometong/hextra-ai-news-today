### Highlights
- Meituan opens public beta for **CatPaw**, an IDE with agent copilots and one-click debugging.
- Post-00 founders unveil **Vinsoo AI IDE**, claiming project-level generation that beats Claude Code using domestic models.
- OpenAI ships **GPT-5 Codex Mini**, a lighter code model while relaxing Plus/Pro rate limits.
- Moonshot open-sources **Kimi K2 Thinking**; researchers warn KV caches beyond pretrain context can break accuracy.
- McKinsey reports 88% AI adoption but only 39% profit growth; devs argue cheap models raise hidden costs.

### Product & Platform
1. **CatPaw (Meituan)** — AI coding environment with an embedded “CatPaw” agent for Q&A, project analysis, and one-click debugging. Public beta signup is live. [[Link]](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/22674)

2. **Vinsoo AI IDE** — Built entirely on domestic models via ultra-long context + multi-agent orchestration, capable of zero-shot project generation. [[Link]](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNjc1NzUzMw==&mid=2247840831&idx=1&sn=a2be5347e8e8eb616e6b14de937e4377)

3. **GPT-5 Codex Mini** — Leaner code model with higher throughput, CLI/IDE extensions live, API “coming soon,” and higher quota for Plus/Pro/Enterprise. [[Link]](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/22666)

### Research Notes
1. **Kimi K2 Thinking** — Open weights + scripts + commercial licence; training cost only USD 4.6M while beating GPT-5 on “human final exam” benchmarks. [[Link]](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/22647)
2. **KV cache pitfalls** — Running beyond the pretraining window breaks RoPE continuity and tanks accuracy worse than OOM. [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04686)
3. **Text-to-robot assembly** — Combining 3D generative AI + VLMs to let robots decompose natural-language specs into structured parts. [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02162)

### Industry / Capital
1. **McKinsey 2025 AI Report** — 88% adoption vs 39% profit growth highlights the gap between feel-good pilots and production results. [[Link]](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNjc1NzUzMw==&mid=2247840831&idx=4&sn=1cc94321e0eb25950aba05e3e81923df)
2. **Beware bargain models** — Engineers note that extra retries, guardrails, and manual QA often erase the savings from cheap APIs.

### Community Signals
- Developers caution that chasing low-cost models can backfire once supervision, re-runs, and integration overhead are included.
