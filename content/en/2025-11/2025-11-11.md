### Highlights
- Meituan opens public beta for **CatPaw**, an IDE with agent copilots and one-click debugging.
- Post‑00 founders reveal **Vinsoo AI IDE**, claiming project-level generation that beats Claude Code using only domestic models.
- OpenAI ships **GPT-5 Codex Mini**, a lightweight, cheaper code model plus higher Plus/Pro rate limits.
- Moonshot open-sources **Kimi K2 Thinking** (exceeds GPT-5 on “human final exams” at USD 4.6M training cost) while researchers expose catastrophic KV cache failures beyond pretrain context.
- McKinsey’s new survey shows 88% of companies adopted AI, yet only 39% see profit growth; devs warn that “cheap” models can create expensive integration debt.

### Product & Platform
- **CatPaw IDE (Meituan)** – ships with an embedded agent that collaborates on Q&A, project analysis, and single-click fixes. Public beta applications are open.
- **Vinsoo AI IDE** – leverages ultra-long context windows + multi-agent orchestration to generate full applications with zero human edits, showcasing China’s rise in AI coding tools.
- **GPT-5 Codex Mini** – a slim code generator with higher throughput, cheaper pricing, CLI/IDE integrations now, API soon; Plus/Pro/Enterprise users also get relaxed rate limits.

### Research Notes
- **Kimi K2 Thinking** – open weights + full training recipes + commercial licence, delivering GPT-5-level reasoning for a fraction of the budget.
- **KV Cache Pitfall** – new work shows pushing caches beyond the pretraining window wrecks RoPE continuity and accuracy more than plain OOM; cache strategies must respect model geometry.
- **Text → Robotic Assembly** – researchers combine 3D generative AI with VLMs so robots can design and assemble multi-component objects via natural-language instructions.

### Industry / Capital
- **McKinsey’s 2025 State of AI**: adoption is high but ROI is scarce, highlighting a gap between pilot projects and production workflows.
- The ongoing AI agent gold rush risks repeating “innovation theatre” unless teams wire agents into measurable business processes.

### Community Signals
- Engineers caution that chasing the cheapest code model can backfire when extra supervision, retries, and integration layers offset the savings.
