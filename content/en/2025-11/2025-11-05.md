### Highlights
- Ant Digital releases a multi-lingual vision training stack that finally handles low-resource IDs; ByteDance’s TRAE drops Claude due to supplier rules.
- Flux1 Krea dev tackles “AI face” aesthetics, gesture-generation gets a real benchmark, SAIL-Embedding offers an omni-modal foundation, TaylorIR reinventes pixel-wise transformers.
- Alpha Arena pits top LLMs against live markets (Qwen leads with +22.32%); Ghibli leads a copyright pushback; OpenAI inks a multi-billion deal with Amazon; macro strategists warn of a “jobless profit boom.”

### Product & Platform
- **Ant’s multi-lingual vision stack** powers ZOLOZ document verification with “think in target language” modelling.
- **TRAE** users lose access to Claude models, underscoring the need for domestic backups.

### Research Notes
- **FLUX.1 Krea dev** trains via two-stage SFT + TPO (a RLHF variant) to remove uncanny artefacts.
- **Gesture Eval Protocol** built on BEAT2 standardises human evaluations for six recent models.
- **SAIL-Embedding** acts as an omni-modal Rosetta stone for recommendation systems.
- **TaylorIR** replaces bulky patch embeddings with 1×1 pixels + TaylorShift attention, cutting memory usage 60%.

### Industry / Capital
- **Alpha Arena** proves LLMs can manage real funds; Qwen3-Max tops the board.
- **Ghibli** and CODA demand AI vendors stop training on unlicensed works.
- **OpenAI × Amazon** sign a seven-year cloud+model pact; analysts warn AI productivity gains may be jobless.
- Hallucinated news spreads faster than corrections; voice-agent startups now sell “digital employees” instead of tooling; Reddit philosophers ponder “AI psychosis.”

### Open Source Radar
- **Linux Server Security Guide** (⭐20k), **Win11Debloat** (⭐31k), **edgevpn** (⭐1.4k), **LinkSwift** (⭐8.4k), **ottomator-agents** (⭐4.6k) all help with infra hygiene, downloads, and agent orchestration.

### Community Signals
- Claude Deep Reading skills, HuggingChat’s 100+ model lineup, Bilibili’s voice-clone translation backlash, AI-generated “good morning” GIFs, Claude Code NotebookLM case studies, eval-writing becoming a superpower, and classic “future tech essays” going viral—proof that workflows and meta-skills now matter as much as raw model power.
