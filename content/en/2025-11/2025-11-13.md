## AI News Daily · 13 Nov 2025

### Highlights
- Baidu World Conference debuts **ERNIE 5.0** (unified native multimodal) plus **Kunlun M100/M300** chips and Tianchi supernodes—tying models, silicon, and products together.
- OpenAI begins rolling out **GPT-5.1** while Google’s **Gemini Live** gets more human-like speech controls; ListenHub releases an MCP server so agents can generate podcasts and audiobooks.
- Surge AI introduces an **Agent Ability Pyramid** showing even top-tier models fail 40% of common-sense tasks—2025 becomes the “common-sense stress test” year.

### Product & Platform
- **ERNIE 5.0** aims for unified representations across text/image/audio while Kunlun hardware provides localised compute.
- **Gemini Live** adds adjustable pace and friendlier dialogue; **GPT-5.1** becomes default for Plus/Pro/Go/Business soon (GPT-5 retires within three months).
- **Unitree G1-D** robot is positioned as a data-collection platform (wheel + lift design, 17–19 DOF, 3 kg payload).

### Research Notes
- Reports on **CRM/CRF simplicity rewards**, **Diff-V2M** video-to-music diffusion, **PPA** stealth attacks on recommenders, and **SGNNs** for mechanistic pretraining illustrate how labs chase efficiency and robustness.

### Open Source Radar
- **TrendRadar** (multi-platform sentiment), **adk-go** (Google’s Go agent SDK), **cursor-free-vip**, **Memori** (memory engine), **ChinaTextbook**, **open-source-games**, **tech-interview-handbook** dominate GitHub watchlists.

### Community Signals
- ListenHub’s MCP integration, Marble model tests (great in fixed scenes, unstable elsewhere), Microsoft AI CEO advocating open-plan offices, plus threads on GPT-5.1 migrations and Gemini Live UX demonstrate practitioners care about day-to-day ergonomics.
