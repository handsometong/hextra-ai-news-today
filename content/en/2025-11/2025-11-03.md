### Highlights
- A viral paper reframes “prompt engineering = context entropy reduction,” giving agent designers a humbling reminder.
- **Sam Altman × Satya Nadella** discuss USD 1.4T in AI capex; layoffs + expansion are thrust under the spotlight.
- OpenAI faces accusations of “the most expensive theft of human knowledge,” while Chinese founders examine the “resource curse” inside large firms.

### Research Watch
- **Context-as-entropy** explains why making models understand intent is tantamount to continuously lowering instruction entropy, providing a workable baseline for prompt/agent design.

### Industry / Capital
- Sam & Satya admit the real bottleneck is power + datacentres. Coupled with mass layoffs, it signals the second phase of the compute arms race.
- **OpenAI data controversies**, Tang Binsen’s “resource curse” talk, and the “big companies chase budgets, small teams craft products” speech all urge teams to reassess growth and value creation.

### Open Source / Tools
- **opencode**, **glow**, **DeepCode**, **LinkSwift**, and **nano-vllm** cover terminal AI, doc reading, agent coding, download acceleration, and lightweight local inference—solid additions to any toolkit.

### Community Signals
- Neon social cards, sober takes on 3D model hype, AI-written posts summarized again by AI (“information loops”), failed 10U AI trading experiments, and bilingual-blogger memes show we welcome efficiency yet remain wary of distortion and bubbles.
