### Highlights
- “Prompt engineering” is reframed as **context entropy reduction**: the goal is to shrink ambiguity until models can act deterministically.
- Sam Altman × Satya Nadella discuss USD 1.4T in AI capex, while tech firms cut headcount to fund GPUs.
- OpenAI faces “knowledge theft” accusations; founders like Tang Binsen warn about the “resource curse” when budgets replace craftsmanship.

### Research Notes
- The Shanghai team’s **context-as-entropy** paper makes prompt design measurable: each instruction reduces entropy until machine decisions align with intent.

### Industry / Capital
- **Sam + Satya** emphasise that the bottleneck isn’t GPUs anymore—it’s power grids and datacentres.
- Critics argue OpenAI monetises the world’s public data; entrepreneurs contrast “zero-budget Xiaomi” stories with resource-heavy giants.

### Open Source Radar
- **opencode** (⭐30k) turns the terminal into an AI outliner; **glow** (⭐20k) renders Markdown in CLI; **DeepCode** (⭐8k) is an autonomous agent framework; **LinkSwift** (⭐7.9k) extracts direct download links; **nano-vllm** (⭐7.4k) offers lightweight inference.

### Community Signals
- Neon social-card prompts, 3D model markets that refuse to hype, AI-generated → AI-digested content loops, joke crypto trades powered by agents, and bilingual blogger antics show how culture keeps remixing AI trends.
