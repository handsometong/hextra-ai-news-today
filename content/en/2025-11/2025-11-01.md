### Highlights
- Moonshot AI launches **Kimi Linear**, shrinking 1M-token KV cache by 75% and bringing ultra-long reasoning back into deployable range.
- OpenAI unveils **Aardvark**, a GPT-5-powered security agent that inspects codebases, reproduces exploits, and ships patches automatically.
- **Figma Weave** and **Canva Grow** show how AI is turning the creative stack into orchestrated nodes.
- Baidu World focuses on embodied intelligence + Kunlun chips—capital and policy keep betting on “physical AI.”

### Product / Feature Updates
- **Kimi Linear** mixes Kimi Delta Attention (linear attention + gated memory). On million-token inputs, decoding throughput jumps up to 6×, perfect for news aggregation, legal review, or compliance archives.
- **Aardvark Security Agent** uses GPT-5 + Codex with multi-agent routing to validate exploits in sandboxes, propose fixes, and create merge requests—moving from “manual detection” to “model patrols.”
- **Figma Weave & Canva Grow** bring node-based creation and “creative OS” concepts to life, connecting models, workflows, and brand assets so teams can go from explore → generate → launch on a single canvas.

### Research Watch
- **DARTS drone sensing** shows lightweight models + thermal imaging can detect accidents 12 minutes earlier—actionable for smart cities.
- **BasicAVSR** bundles flow-guided propagation, second-order motion compensation, and Laplacian priors into a “video Swiss army knife” for watermark removal, super-resolution, and restoration.

### Industry & Capital
- **Steve Zhou (Unitree)** predicts a physical-intelligence inflection post GPT-6; chip+robot combos aim to bridge “model to embodiment.”
- **LiblibAI** raises USD 130M Series B, evolving from model community to creative studio; **Google × Jio AI Pro** shows how 5G + Gemini packages can blanket emerging markets.

### Open Source / Tools
- **claude-relay-service** (⭐4.6k) abstracts multiple LLM subscriptions into one relay layer, slashing API costs and key management.
- **BettaFish** offers multi-agent sentiment tracking for non-tech users; **ai-engineering-hub** curates full LLM/RAG/Agent curricula for self-taught engineers.

### Community Signals
- Amazon’s USD 125B compute plan highlights the “expansion speed = monetisation speed” equation and shows clouds no longer fear capex.
- **Cursor Composer’s Chinese aside, Andrew Ng’s “idea → implementation” record lows, Codex credit billing**, and “GPUs cheaper than payroll” debates all point to AI rewriting language, pricing, and job structures simultaneously.
