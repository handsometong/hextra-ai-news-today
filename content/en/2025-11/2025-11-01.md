### Highlights
- Moonshot AI ships **Kimi Linear**: KV cache shrinks 75% on 1M-token contexts while decoding throughput jumps 6×, making extreme-length summarisation deployable again.
- OpenAI's **Aardvark** agent (GPT-5 + Codex) patrols repos, reproduces exploits, and files patches—security becomes model-native.
- **Figma Weave** and **Canva Grow** show how AI-native creative OSes stitch model nodes into campaign workflows.
- Baidu doubles down on embodied intelligence (Kunlun chips + robots); **LiblibAI** closes a record USD 130M Series B; Amazon earmarks USD 125B for AI infra.

### Product & Platform
1. **Kimi Linear** combines hybrid linear attention with Delta-style gating so million-token meeting notes can run on commodity GPUs. Perfect for newsletters, policy docs, or academic corpora.
2. **Aardvark** works like an autonomous AppSec engineer: it analyses diffs, spins up sandbox PoCs, auto-patches code, and files the full report so humans can focus on triage.
3. **Figma Weave** (node-based generative canvas) + **Canva Grow** (AI campaign cockpit) prove that “creative OS” now means chaining internal models + workflow templates rather than gluing point tools.

### Research Notes
- **DARTS** (drone-based thermal sensing) beats conventional traffic centres by 12 minutes when spotting collisions—useful for civic deployments.
- **BasicAVSR** merges Laplacian priors, flow-guided propagation, and second-order motion compensation, giving one open baseline for video SR, watermark removal, and restoration tasks.

### Industry / Capital
- **Agibot co-founder Steve Zhou** believes GPT-6 will usher in the first “physical AI wave” as robots inherit model intelligence.
- **LiblibAI**’s USD 130M round (Sequoia China et al.) explains why model+studio hybrids attract funding: they own both generation and distribution.
- **Google × Jio** bundle Gemini 2.5 Pro + NotebookLM + 2 TB storage for Indian users; **Amazon** publicly ties faster AI capex to faster monetisation.

### Open Source Radar
- **claude-relay-service** (⭐4.6k) unifies Claude/OpenAI/Gemini subscriptions, ideal for teams that share API quotas.
- **BettaFish** (⭐2.2k) offers a beginner-friendly multi-agent opinion-mining assistant.
- **ai-engineering-hub** (⭐20k) curates LLM/RAG/Agent curricula for self-taught engineers.

### Community Signals
- Amazon’s “our expansion speed equals monetisation speed” memo, Cursor Composer unexpectedly switching to Mandarin, Andrew Ng’s “idea→implementation distance has never been shorter,” Codex credit billing, and “GPUs cheaper than payroll” debates all show how AI is rewriting language, pricing, and labour assumptions at once.
