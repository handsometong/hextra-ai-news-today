## AI News Daily · 9 Nov 2025

> `AI News` | `Daily Briefing` | `Tools` | `Research` | `Industry` | `Open Source` | `Human Impact`

### Highlights
- **Inworld TTS** hits 0.25s latency, supports emotion-rich voices, and releases its training stack.
- Google unveils **DS-STAR**, a multi-agent “AI data scientist”; Camel AI explains how to “brainwash” agents so their memories stay clean.
- Alibaba quietly backs Chinese frontier-model startups with both capital and infra; Emad Mostaque argues all LLMs currently train without moral guardrails.

### Product & Platform
- **Inworld TTS** blends instant voice cloning, WebSocket streaming, and interruptible playback—ideal for NPCs or customer service bots.

### Research Notes
- **DS-STAR** coordinates Planner, Coder, Verifier, Executor agents to handle CSVs, SQL, charts, and iterative QA.
- **Camel AI** advocates context summarisation + workflow memory: summarise after each turn, store reusable knowledge outside the main token window.

### Industry / Capital
- **Alibaba** serves as both investor and infra provider for Moonshot, Zhipu, etc.—a “fund + compute + scenario” ecosystem.
- **Emad Mostaque** calls for Asimov-style rules baked into pretraining so AGI doesn’t emerge value-free.

### Open Source Radar
- **umami** (privacy-first analytics), **LocalStack** (local AWS), **Airweave** (agent context router), **MLX-Audio Studio** (Apple Silicon TTS/STT cockpit) remain top downloads.

### Community Signals
- **Qwen Image Edit** demo of “camera angle control,” **ERNIE-5.0 Preview** hitting #2 on LMArena, and lively debates on toolchains and prompts illustrate how Chinese models are gaining global credibility.
