### Highlights
- StepFun releases **Step-Audio-EditX** (3B parameters) with zero-shot voice cloning, multi-stage emotion edits, and dialect imitation; **Google Finance Beta** embeds AIled investment Q&A; rumours swirl around **Nano Banana 2**.
- Step-Audio’s paper unifies all audio tasks under conversational LLM frameworks; NB2 nails prompts like “clock pointing to 11:15, wine glass full,” proving fine-grained spatial reasoning.
- The Register calls many AI benchmarks “bad jokes,” while analysts argue humanoid robots may be propelled by less noble consumer markets; observers note “overseas invent, China engineers.”

### Product & Platform
- **Step-Audio-EditX** open-sources demos + HuggingFace space for real-time testing.
- **Google Finance Beta** auto-summarises stock outlooks with verified citations.
- **Nano Banana 2** quietly appears inside Media IO, showcasing precise instruction following.

### Research Notes

- **Nano Banana 2** experiments underline the need for precise prompt compliance metrics.

### Industry / Capital
- Editorials slam current leaderboards for rewarding cherry-picked tests.
- Tombkeeper suggests humanoids may be bankrolled by adult-use demand, not factories.
- Analysts describe a division of labour: Western labs lead in cognition theory, Chinese teams excel in engineering distillation.

### Open Source Radar
- **tinker-cookbook**, **airweave**, **librespot**, **Zig**, etc. help teams own their infrastructure end-to-end.

### Community Signals
- Reddit threads comparing agentic coding tools, PPT prompt packs, and reflections on K2-Thinking’s “slow but brilliant” style show builders care about workflow fit, not just flash.
