### Highlights
- StepFun drops the 3B-parameter **Step-Audio-EditX** (zero-shot cloning + multi-round emotion edits); **Google Finance Beta** embeds AI Q&A; **Nano Banana 2** reignites debates on fine-grained instruction following.
- Step-Audio’s paper unifies audio tasks inside conversational frameworks; NB2’s “clock at 11:15” precision shows multimodal reasoning still accelerating.
- The Register blasts benchmarks as “jokes,” Tombkeeper questions humanoid robot incentives, and overseas observers say “the West invents theory, China engineers it.”

### Product / Feature Updates
- **Step-Audio-EditX** turns emotion/accent/style into an iterative workflow.
- **Google Finance Beta** lets retail investors ask, “What’s the outlook on this stock?” with cited answers.
- **Nano Banana 2** isn’t official yet, but leaked Media IO clips show near-human instruction fidelity.

### Research Watch
- **Step-Audio’s unified architecture** + **NB2’s careful plotting experiments** prove multimodal LLMs still chase “language controlling every sense.”

### Industry / Capital
- Benchmark farce critiques, speculation that humanoids are driven by adult markets, and the “overseas theory + domestic engineering” split all warn practitioners not to worship leaderboards—focus on real needs and differentiated edges.

### Open Source / Tools
- **tinker-cookbook**, **airweave**, **librespot**, **Zig**, etc., cover post-training, agent context, custom players, and system languages—giving engineers leverage.

### Community Signals
- Threads on favourite agentic coding tools, PPT prompt packs, and “K2-Thinking is slow but brilliant” show people stress-testing workflows before committing.
