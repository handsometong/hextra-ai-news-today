- Provide core materials and schedule a 30-minute prep call.

### 2. Community events & talks
- Invite me to speak about AI industry takeaways, workflow design, or indie hacking.
- Share logistics (topic, audience, recording plan) so we can align expectations.

### 3. Media / institutional partnerships
- Request content licensing, co-branded columns, or sponsorship packages.
- Include distribution channels, launch timeline, and success metrics.

### 4. Urgent matters
- If you spot factual errors or copyright issues, mark the email subject as “URGENT” with supporting details. These take priority.
